This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Demo project (WIP)

The main point of this project is to play with animated routes. It's not meant to be a production level project.

## Project internals

Built using:

- [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router) - JSX based router system for React.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - Visual primitives for the component age.
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

Included in the project are demonstrations of new React features: 

- [react-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cache) - provides simple caching
- [Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#suspense) - provides loading fallback
- [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - not yet in repo, but will be soon
